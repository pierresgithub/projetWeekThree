      <h1>hummus history and properties</h1>

      <p>The earliest known recipes for a dish similar to hummus bi tahina are recorded in cookbooks written in Cairo in the 13th century.[8] Hummus has been connected to the Ayyubid Sultan, Saladin, and according to some food historians he first prepared it.[9] A cold purée of chickpeas with vinegar and pickled lemons with herbs, spices, and oil, but no tahini or garlic, appears in the Kanz al-Fawa'id fi Tanwi' al-Mawa'id;[10] and a purée of chickpeas and tahini called hummus kasa appears in the Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada: it is based on puréed chickpeas and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (though not lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nuts, and no garlic. It is also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight,[11] which presumably gives it a very different texture from hummus bi tahina. Indeed, its basic ingredients—chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic—have been eaten in the region for millennia.[12][13] Though chickpeas were widely eaten in the region, and they were often cooked in stews and other hot dishes,[14] puréed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini do not appear before the Abbasid period in Egypt and the Levant.

    <h2>nutrition</h2>
    <div id=hummusnutrition>

     <p>Chickpeas, the main ingredient of conventional hummus, have appreciable contents of dietary fiber, protein, B vitamins, manganese and other nutrients.[26]

As hummus recipes vary, so does nutritional content, depending primarily on the relative proportions of chickpeas, tahini, and water. Hummus provides roughly 170 calories for 100 grams, and is a good to excellent (more than 10% of the Daily Value) source of dietary fiber, B vitamins, and several dietary minerals.[27][28]

Fat content, mostly from tahini and olive oil, is about 14% of the total; other major components are 65% water, 17% total carbohydrates, including a small amount of sugar, and about 10% protein.
In addition to protein and fiber, the chickpeas used in hummus are high in iron, folate, phosphorus, and B vitamins (all especially important for vegetarians and vegans who may be lacking in these nutrients). Lemon juice also contains a high level of immunity boosting vitamin C and antioxidants.
Thanks to its high fiber content, one of the benefits of hummus is that it can keep your digestive tract regular. It’s an effective and tasty way to get more fiber into your diet and fiber itself has other health benefits like helping to prevent heart disease.
